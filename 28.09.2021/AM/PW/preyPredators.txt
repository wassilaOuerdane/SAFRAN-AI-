## Implementing a Prey - Predator simulation with Mesa


The objective of this practical work is to implement a simulation of a Prey - Predator model. The Prey - Predator model is a simple ecological model, consisting of three agent types: wolves, sheep, and grass. The wolves and the sheep wander around the grid at random. Wolves and sheep both expend energy moving around, and replenish it by eating. Sheep eat grass, and wolves eat sheep if they end up on the same grid cell.

If wolves and sheep have enough energy, they reproduce, creating a new wolf or sheep (in this simplified model, only one parent is needed for reproduction). The grass on each cell regrows at a constant rate. If any wolves and sheep run out of energy, they die.

The implementation of this model will make you use several Mesa concepts and features:
MultiGrid.
Multiple agent types (wolves, sheep, grass).
Overlay arbitrary text (wolf’s energy) on agent’s shapes while drawing on CanvasGrid.
Agents inheriting a behavior (random movement) from an abstract parent
Writing a model composed of multiple files.
Dynamically adding and removing agents from the schedule.
The goal is to implement a Prey - Predator model closely based on the NetLogo Wolf-Sheep Predation Model: Wilensky, U. (1997). NetLogo Wolf Sheep Predation model. http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/WolfSheepPredation
